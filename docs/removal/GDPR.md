# ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡º GDPR request template

You can use this template regardless of your country of residence but contacting the data protection authorities will require residing in an EU country. Discord no longer accepts support tickets requesting "bulk deletion" directly, instead, you should leverage personally identifiable information clause.

### Removal of personally identifiable information under GDPR - @username

> Hello,
> 
> I am writing to formally request the deletion of personally identifiable information as listed in the attached "messages.csv" file under the GDPR. The file contains a list of channels, including many I no longer have access to, which prevents me from managing those messages myself. The document has been properly formatted to comply with the specified requirements. I understand the potential concerns regarding context, but my right to privacy takes priority.
> 
> Best regards.
